# SISYPHUS Global Systems

We have built a web portal that utilized ArcGIS maps and WebXR to provide different users (in the pilot city of New Orleans) with an immersive augmented reality experience of assessing their properties' flood risks, and viewing their city's green and grey infrastructure. Currently, our immersive experiences are provided as demonstrations, but eventually, we hope to complete the back end code to enable automated predictions of flood risk for individual properties and a 3D rendered map of city infrastructure, which will be useful for individual home owners as well as officials such as city planners to implement flood mitigation strategies.   

Our web-app comprises of the following pages:
1) A home page for a user to submit their house address to assess the flood risk
2) A New Orleans Green-Grey Infrastructure Page map: This map curated by our team's GIS experts displays the current state of New Orleans green and grey infrastructure. Users can also overlay a flood risk map to visualize how the presence (or lack) of appropriate green and grey infrastructure minimizes (or enhances) flood inundation risk. 
3) Flood Map AR_Table Demo: users are able to render the flood risk map for New Orleans onto a lot surface to visualize it interactively.
4) Home Flood AR_Room Demo: users are able to visualize how our app will provide predictions for their property's flood risk.
5) Green Infrastructure AR_World Demo: users can view New Orleans' green infrastructure projects and access the ecosystem service data.

## The following steps are required to run our application: 
### Part 1:
A) Using Code Engine: 
Docker image: docker.io/uqktiwar/sisyphus:latest
code engine app URL: https://app-e3.cml40ggv51o.jp-osa.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/ 

B) In case our code engine deployment fails, please follow the following steps to deploy the website: 
1) Install dependencies: python-3, django
2) Clone the github repo: https://github.com/trungvu08/CFC_SISYPHUS_Global_Systems.git
3) CD into the repository: cd CFC_SISYPHUS_Global_Systems
4) run the following cmd in terminal: python manage.py runserver
5) The application will be hosted at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
6) Configure browser to use WebXR: 
To be able to run the AR pages on your desktop browser install the WebXR Emulator extension for Chrome browsers. A handy description is provided here: https://blog.mozvr.com/webxr-emulator-extension/
### Part 2:
A) For our Green Infrastructure AR_World Demo, download the free ArcGIS AppStudio Player from the Apple App Store. Upon opening the app...
1) Select "Sign In" then select "Sign In" under the ArcGIS Online section
2) Sign in with username "test@gn" and password "gn@94596"
3) Click on the "SHARED" tab
4) Download "Green Infrastructure AR" and select that section once the download completes
5) Do NOT grant the app location access, but do grant the app camera access
6) Proceed to sign in again using the same information from Step #2
7) Select the "1027_green_infrastructure" data source
8) Deselect the bottom-right, blue circle to prevent being moved to your current location
8) Select the top-right 3-bar menu and select the bottom-left "Map" button
9) Select the top-right 3-bar menu again and select "Settings"
10) In settings, go to the "Popups" tab and checkmark all properties
11) You can switch from GIS view to AR view by using the left purple bar to "refresh"

# Extra Information:
# SISYPHUS won the 2021 IBM AI Spot Challenge.
Visit the [repository](https://github.com/uqktiwar/IBM_SpotAI_SISYPHUS) or see its contents below. 

## Solution Description
For the AI Spot Challenge we utilized an appropriate hybrid data-management strategy. 
We tested multiple supervised machine learning algorithms using the Cloud Pak Auto AI service with our ground-up built dataset. 
We are exploring Watson Studio & Cloud Pak for future unsupervised ML (e.g., dimensionality reduction) with our multicloud data platform. 
We can scale the data architecture across government, professional and community stakeholders for needed capabilities to drive smarter mitigation planning decisions and prioritize project implementation. 

Our ultimate aim is to reliably predict the flood risk associated with properties in New Orleans (our pilot city for this project) and deliver the results 
to different stake holders (home-owners, government officials etc.) in an interactive manner combining the power of machine learning/AI and augmented reality. 
For the IBM CFC Global challenge, we submitted a web app (https://github.com/trungvu08/CFC_SISYPHUS_Global_Systems) that utilizes ArcGIS maps and WebXR to provide different users 
with an immersive augmented reality experience of assessing their properties' flood risks, and viewing their city's green and grey infrastructure. 
The immersive experiences in that solution were provided as demonstrations.

For the AI Spot challenge, we took the first step towards completing the back end code to enable automated predictions of flood risk for individual properties.
Since, we are not currently at liberty to release data from indivdual properties, we aggregated the data according to census blocks. 
We used this test dataset (flood_risk_binary_rm_ufeats_labels.csv) describing various attributes (land use, water area, tree count, no. of buildings, repetitive flood loss etc.) of these census blocks to predict the FIRM score.
The FIRM score represents a "Flood insurance rating" issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with a high FIRM score indicative of a high flood risk. 

## About the Dataset
### The following variables were used as predictors in our model:

LOTCNT= Total number of lots per census block group

GRADEDLOTS= number of lots we survey in research

STRUCTURE= number of structure (building) per census block group

VACANT= number of vacant lot per census block group

VACANT%= percentage of vacant 

SLAB= number of slab structure per census block group

CRAWLSP= number of crawlspace structure per census block group

RAISED= number of raised structure per census block group

FREEBRD= number of freeboard structure per census block group (important: these are structure that are mitigated)

RLPROP= number of Repetitive floor loss properties per census block group (important: these till how many properties flood repeatedly)

CLAIMSTL= total number of flood claims per census block group

AVECLAIMS= Average number of claims per Repetitive flood loss property

LOTTOTACRES= census block group total area in acres

LOTAVEACRES= lot average area in acres

LOTSTDEV= lot average area standard deviation 

BLKGRPACRES= block average area in acres

BLKCOUNT= block per census block group

LOT/BLK= average number of lots per block

ROADAREAACRES= road area in meter square

ROAD/LOT= road to lot ratio

TREECNT= total number of trees per census block group

TREE/ACRE=trees per acre

HISTZONE= historic zone land use (1 good to 7 bad)

### The following attribute was predicted:

FIRM_BINARY = [Low_Risk, High_Risk]

## Methodology
### Training and Selecting the Best ML Model

We used the IBM Auto AI Service to test multiple machine learning algorithms to finally select the "Extra Trees Classifier" as the best algorithm for modelling our data.
